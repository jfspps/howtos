# Introduction to Jakarta EE

This demo introduces some of the basic project setup requirements to build a modern Java EE (Jakarta EE) web application resource, or WAR. The WAR can be deployed to an application server, such as [Payara Micro](https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/) (a derivative of [Oracle GlassFish Server](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/glassfish-server.html)). The option to build a Java archive, or JAR, with Payara Micro included is available.

The key ideas and annotations used, provided in the project's readme, are:

+ Java bean and JPA configurations via XML
+ Servlets (controllers) which handle routing as extensions to the web server
+ REST endpoint exposure
+ Templates with JSP and JSF
